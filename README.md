⚙️ Project Workflow

This project follows a structured Fabric ETL pipeline, executed through a PySpark notebook and SQL queries:

1️⃣ Extract — API Data Collection

File: notebook/anime_ingestion_cleaning.ipynb

✔ Connects to Jikan REST API
✔ Fetches anime metadata (title, score, genres, type, popularity, etc.)
✔ Raw JSON is converted into a PySpark DataFrame

2️⃣ Transform — Data Cleaning in PySpark

The PySpark notebook performs the following:

✔ Extracts nested fields (genres, studios)
✔ Handles missing values
✔ Casts numeric fields
✔ Renames and selects key analytics columns
✔ Creates the final cleaned table: anime_cleaned

➡ Output stored in Fabric Lakehouse (Delta Format)

3️⃣ Load — Store & Query with Fabric SQL Endpoint

SQL files located in the sql/ folder include:

SQL File	Purpose
sql_top_anime.sql	Top 10 anime by score
sql_genre_count.sql	Count of anime per genre
sql_year_count.sql	Anime distribution by year

✔ The Delta table is queryable inside Fabric using SQL Analytics Endpoint
✔ Results feed into the Power BI dashboard

🖥️ Technologies & Tools Used
Tool / Tech	Purpose
Python (PySpark)	Data ingestion & transformation inside Fabric Notebook
Requests, Pandas	API calls & initial data handling
Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse	Storage of raw & cleaned Delta tables
Fabric SQL Endpoint	Running analytical SQL queries
Power BI Desktop	Interactive dashboard & visuals
Git & GitHub	Version control & project hosting
🚀 How to Run This Project End-to-End
✅ Prerequisites

Microsoft Fabric workspace

Python environment inside Fabric Notebook

Power BI Desktop installed

Git installed (optional, for local work)

📌 Step-by-Step Setup
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mishragourav0006-ops/anime_fabric_project.git
cd anime_fabric_project

2️⃣ Open the PySpark notebook in Microsoft Fabric

Navigate to:

notebook/anime_ingestion_cleaning.ipynb


Run all cells to:

✔ Fetch API data
✔ Clean & transform it
✔ Save the final Delta table into Lakehouse

3️⃣ Run SQL Queries (Optional but Recommended)

Open each SQL file inside sql/:

-- Example: Top Anime
SELECT title, score
FROM anime_cleaned
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 10;


These queries validate the dataset and feed into Power BI modeling.

4️⃣ Open the Power BI Dashboard

Download the dataset via Fabric SQL endpoint
Import into Power BI → build visuals OR open your saved .pbix file
View insights like:

Top-rated anime

Genre distribution

Score trends

Anime type breakdown

Popularity vs Score correlations

📊 Dashboard Insights (Summary)

✔ TV anime dominate the dataset compared to Movies
✔ Action & Comedy are the most frequent genres
✔ Rating trends show peak quality around 1999–2003
✔ Some anime score high but are not extremely popular (and vice-versa)
✔ Studios contribute differently to score and popularity metrics
